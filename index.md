# Bio

I am Yee Wei Law (羅裔緯) or “Law” for short. I received my BEng, MEng and PhD degrees from University of Southampton, Nanyang Technological University, and University of Twente respectively. I was born in Malaysia, but I have been an Australian citizen since 2011.

I am currently a Senior Lecturer at Adelaide University.
- From 2021 to 2025, I was a Senior Lecturer at University of South Australia (UniSA).
- From 2017 to 2021, I was the Program Director at UniSA for multiple electrical-related BEng (Hons) programs, namely Electrical and Electronic Engineering (ESE-LHIF), Electrical and Mechatronic Engineering (EMC-LHIF), Electrical and Electronic Engineering + Business (LBZB), and Mechatronic Engineering (LHEG).
- Before joining UniSA, I was a Research Fellow at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Melbourne. I also contributed to teaching at Deakin University.

# Research

My research interests covered a broad spectrum, but I am currently focusing on cybersecurity (partly funded by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources through the [Critical Technologies Challenge Program](https://www.industry.gov.au/science-technology-and-innovation/industry-innovation/critical-technologies-challenge-program)), machine-learning-based applications for space systems (partly funded by the Department of Education through [iLAuNCH](https://ilaunch.space/)), adversarial machine learning (partly funded by [AOARD](https://www.afrl.af.mil/)), as well as machine prognostics and health management (partly funded by [SA Water](https://www.sawater.com.au/)).

I was involved with numerous European projects on sensor networks, including EYES, SENSEI, Internet of Things Initiative, SmartSantander and SocIoTal; in particular, I was a Chief Investigator in the last three projects. In Australia, I was involved with ARC-funded sensor network and smart city testbed projects. I am serving on the editorial board for [International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/dsn) and [Journal of Computer Security and Data Forensics](https://jcsdf.sdust.edu.cn/). My publications can be found in ACM Transactions, IEEE Transactions, IEEE Magazines, EURASIP Journals and more, earning me a [Google Scholar H-index of 28](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cJTPOloAAAAJ).

# Teaching

As of 2026, I am coordinating and teaching [COMP 1006 Engineering Programming](https://adelaideuni.edu.au/study/courses/comp-1006/) and [ENGE X421 Telecommunication System Security](https://adelaideuni.edu.au/study/courses/engex-421/). I developed [ENGE X411 Telecommunication Device and Network Security](https://adelaideuni.edu.au/study/courses/engex-411/), but I am not teaching the course.

I developed and taught the following courses at UniSA:

| Course | Year range |
| ------ | ---------- |
| [COMP 5074 Cryptography and Data Protection](https://study.unisa.edu.au/courses/172215) | 2022-2024 |
| [COMP 5075 Telecommunications and Device Security](https://study.unisa.edu.au/courses/172216) | 2023-2025 |
| EEET 2044 Electromechanics | 2020-2021 |
| [EEET 3016 Power Electronics](https://study.unisa.edu.au/courses/010830) | 2021-2025 |
| EEET 3046 Control Systems | 2014-2020 |
| EEET 4071 Advanced Control | 2014-2021 |

 A common thread in my teaching is model-based design, supported by analytical problem solving and computational thinking.

# Misc

On 5 December 2021, I co-founded [Mesh in Space](https://meshin.space). On 9 February 2022, Mesh in Space was admitted into the [Venture Catalyst Space](https://icc.unisa.edu.au/programs/venture-catalyst-space) program. However, on 8 February 2023, all co-founders decided to take a break from the start-up scene and focus on research.
